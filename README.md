A Redo Of A Previous Project (Can Be Found In The 'Final-Project--' Repo which has been made private upon professors request)

Done After Assignment Due Date To Improve The Code And Clean-Up The Program

**Program Description:**
- A Ghost Has Haunted A Building! It Is Up To The 4 Hunters To Figure Out 
What Type Of Ghost Has Taken Over & Capture It!
- Hunters Must Go Around Each Room Of The Building, Looking For Clues The Ghost Leaves Behind
- Careful! Sometimes The Ghost Leaves Some False Evidence To Confuse The Hunters
- If The Hunters Get Too Scared Or Too Bored, They May Just Leave, Letting The Ghost Roam Free
- If The Ghost Gets Too Bored, It May Go To Another Building! Then The Hunters Will Never Find It
